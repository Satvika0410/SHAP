# 📊 SHAP Explainability Project – Multi-Domain Interpretations

This repository contains SHAP-based explainability analyses across **four diverse machine learning domains**: toxic gas detection, phenotype classification, EEG signal classification, and agriculture-based predictions. The goal is to interpret model behavior, identify impactful features, and improve transparency.

## 📁 Notebooks Overview

### 1. **ToxicGas_SHAP.ipynb**
- **Task**: Predict presence of toxic gases based on sensor input.
- **Model**: Likely Random Forest or XGBoost.
- **SHAP Use**: Identifies which gas concentrations or conditions most affect predictions.
- **Impact**: Helps in understanding key indicators for gas leak alerts.

---

### 2. **Phenotypes (1).ipynb**
- **Task**: Classify biological phenotypes based on gene expression or clinical data.
- **SHAP Use**: Highlights critical phenotypic markers and enables domain-driven biological insight.
- **Impact**: Supports research in bioinformatics and precision medicine.

---

### 3. **EEG-SHAP (3).ipynb**
- **Task**: Classify brain signal patterns (e.g., attention, drowsiness) from EEG data.
- **SHAP Use**: Reveals which EEG signal channels or frequency features drive classification.
- **Impact**: Useful in neuroscience, BCI (Brain-Computer Interfaces), or mental state monitoring.

---

### 4. **Agriculture_SHAP.ipynb**
- **Task**: Predict agricultural outcomes such as yield, crop type, or soil health.
- **SHAP Use**: Explains the effect of weather, soil parameters, and farming practices on predictions.
- **Impact**: Enables smarter decisions in precision agriculture.

## 🔍 What is SHAP?

**SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** is a game-theory-based framework for explaining the output of machine learning models.

- Provides **global and local interpretability**
- Shows **how much each feature contributes** (positively or negatively)
- Supports **tree-based models**, linear models, and more

## 🧪 Libraries Used

- Python 3.10+
